	* Rewrote packet building function in FirmwareNovintSDK class to deal with partial packets
	* Added ENABLE_GPROF option to build with -pg for gprof profiling
	* Added sample udev files for linux device setup
	* Removed C-based libnifalcon libraries from default builds, since they're no longer being kept up
	* Removed findfalcons_cpp from being installed, since falcon_test_cli is the useful one

	* Added firmware loading from memory
	* Added firmware as header includes
	* Added bin2h python utility for firmware conversion
	* Added nvent extracted firmware (considered to be 'release' firmware)
	* Moved includes to include directory to mirror final install state
	* Updated all libnifalcon includes to reflect proper full path

	* Fixed bug with returning grip info data portion from novint firmware object
	* Fixed library misnaming for C libraries (Thanks to Stephen Sinclair)
	* Removed automatic ftd2xx building from Mac and Linux due to symbol issues (now requires explicit CMake option setting - FORCE_FTD2XX_BUILD)

	* Added GMTL to source distribution
	* Folded Stamper kinematics functionality into main library
2008-10-05 Kyle Machulis <kyle@nonpolynomial.com>
	* Release v1 alpha 2
	* Added beginnings of HDL compatibility libraries
