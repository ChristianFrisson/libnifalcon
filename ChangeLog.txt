libnifalcon ChangeLog
=====================

2009-03-08 Kyle Machulis <kyle@nonpolynomial.com>
	* Release v1 beta 3
	* Overhauled CMake system because I didn't really know what I was doing with it the first time around
	* Added logging capabilities using Apache's log4cxx library
	* Removed C code completely, still available in repository (boneyard directory) but no longer distributed in source tarballs
	* Rearranged src directory to only contain what used to be in cpp directory
	* Added pregen'd angular matrix LUT header since it currently never changes but takes a bit of time to generate on some systems
	* Added logging level options to FalconCLIBase
	* Fixed lots of small bugs in findfalcons_cpp, FalconCLIBase, falcon_test_cli
2008-12-06 Kyle Machulis <kyle@nonpolynomial.com>
	* Release v1 beta 2
	* Changed units in stamper kinematic core position readings from millimeters to meters
	* Changed units in stamper kinematic core force values to newtons (now matches HDAL)
	* Changed units in FalconGeometry to meters
	* Updated falcon_test_cli to reflect unit changes
	* Added many more comments, though still nothing in depth
	* Removed falcon_mouse demo (many people have difficulty building and it doesn't work right, moved to own repository, http://www.github.com/qdot/libnifalcon_mouse)
	* Fixed some const/reference passing arguments
	* Changed comm libraries to use pointers and prototypes to remove necessity for comm includes in lib headers
	* Fixed FTD2XX compatibility (comm driver hadn't been working in the past few releases)
	* Fixed compilation and compatibility for windows (now using mingw as test compiler)
2008-11-16 Kyle Machulis <kyle@nonpolynomial.com>
	* Release v1 beta 1
	* Added libusb-1.0 support for linux
	* Rewrote packet building function in FirmwareNovintSDK class to deal with partial packets
	* Added ENABLE_GPROF option to build with -pg for gprof profiling
	* Added sample udev files for linux device setup
	* Removed C-based libnifalcon libraries from default builds, since they're no longer being kept up
	* Removed findfalcons_cpp from being installed, since falcon_test_cli is the useful one
	* Fixed RPATH sets in cmake

	* Added firmware loading from memory
	* Added firmware as header includes
	* Added bin2h python utility for firmware conversion
	* Added nvent extracted firmware (considered to be 'release' firmware)
	* Moved includes to include directory to mirror final install state
	* Updated all libnifalcon includes to reflect proper full path

	* Fixed bug with returning grip info data portion from novint firmware object
	* Fixed library misnaming for C libraries (Thanks to Stephen Sinclair)
	* Removed automatic ftd2xx building from Mac and Linux due to symbol issues (now requires explicit CMake option setting - FORCE_FTD2XX_BUILD)
	* Added cmake option for libusb debug messages (LIBUSB_DEBUG)
	* Added execution flags to the FalconDevice runIOLoop function
2008-10-11 Kyle Machulis <kyle@nonpolynomial.com>
	* Release v1 alpha 3

	* Added GMTL to source distribution
	* Folded Stamper kinematics functionality into main library
2008-10-05 Kyle Machulis <kyle@nonpolynomial.com>
	* Release v1 alpha 2
	* Added beginnings of HDL compatibility libraries
