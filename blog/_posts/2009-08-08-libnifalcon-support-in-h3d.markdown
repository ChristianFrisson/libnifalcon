As of commit 473 to the HAPI repository (which actually happened almost two months ago), libnifalcon support is officially in the [H3D Haptics Engine][1]! This means you can now use the falcon in H3D on OS X or Linux. I've tested it on OS X, and it seems to work great so far.

You can find out more info or pick up the source yourself (you'll need to do a checkout of the svn repo) at
